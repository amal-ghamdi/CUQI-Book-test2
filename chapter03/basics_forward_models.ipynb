    "# Forward models, data generation and forward UQ\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we dive into forward models in CUQIpy. In brief, a forward model is defined as a mathematical model that describes the relationship between some input parameters (which are not directly observable) and some output data (which is observable).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of inverse problems, forward models are an important concept. If the forward model is ill-conditioned, it will amplifies noise or uncertainties in the data and the inverse problem then becomes *ill-posed*, which means that existence, uniqueness and/or stability of inversion cannot be guaranteed. This ill-posedness deserves a separate discussion, which is out-of-scope for this notebook and we refer to [1] for the interested reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this notebook, we show the basics of how to use forward models in CUQIpy. In particular for generating simulated noisy data and some forward uncertainty quantification. Finally, we also show how to define new custom linear or non-linear forward models in CUQIpy from either a matrix or functions.\n",
