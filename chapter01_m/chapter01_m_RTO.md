# ⚠️ Regularized linear Randomize-Then-Optimize (RTO) methods

> ⚠️ **Contents to be added:** We can consider adding a section on regularized linear RTO methods here. And present an example or link to previously created examples. Some of the code we already have for this is in https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/Paper-Implicit and https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy-User-Showcase/blob/main/005_Implicit_Regularized_Gaussian/implicit_priors.ipynb
