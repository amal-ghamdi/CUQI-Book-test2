# Uncertainty Quantification in Inverse Problems with CUQIpy

Welcome to the book on "Uncertainty Quantification in Inverse Problems with CUQIpy".
This book contains training material on how to use the [CUQIpy](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy) library for uncertainty quantification in inverse problems. It also covers some of the theoretical background behind the methods implemented in CUQIpy.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** The code in this book runs without a fixed random seed, so results will vary with each re-compilation and user run. While conclusions should remain consistent, specific values may differ due to the probabilistic nature of Bayesian sampling, which is fundamental when working with uncertainty quantification.
