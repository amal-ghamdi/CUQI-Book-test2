# ⚠️ Implicit priors

> ⚠️ **Contents to be added:** provide our definition of implicit priors, why they are useful, and how do we categorize them. We can possibly either provide few 1D/2D examples of these priors (similar to what is presented in the paper https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/Paper-Implicit/blob/master/simplest_linear/simplest_linear.ipynb and https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/Paper-Implicit/blob/master/simplest_nonlinear/simplest_nonlinear.ipynb) or simply refer to these notebooks. Provide a reference to the implicit paper as well. Also, the focus here can be on defining implicit priors and categorizing them, while the actual sampling methods can be discussed in subsequent sections/chapters.
